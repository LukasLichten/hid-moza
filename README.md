# hid-mozaff
~~Attempt at a Linux FFB driver for Moza Wheelbase(s).~~  
~~*But I have no idea what I am doing, and the attention span of a goldfish, this project will likely go nowhere.*~~  
There is already a driver (just that it is not well publicied).


## State
There is a FFB driver in the form of [universal-pidff](https://github.com/JacKeTUs/universal-pidff) that supports Moza wheelbases.

I will leave this repo up for now, as I wrote quite a guide for doing usb packet sniffing, you can check out the `wireshark` folder for this.
